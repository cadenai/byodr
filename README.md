# Byodr - Build Your Own Delivery Robot 

Routine transport of small goods - packages, medicine, inspection equipment - can be done autonomously with simple routes. 
An unmanned vehicle is built to be smaller, cheaper and more energy efficient, because there is no driver on board. 
Such a vehicle requires teleoperation by an operator and self-driving software.  
This project comprises the set of software services that run this rover and others like it.

> We went ahead and designed a rover that can be assembled from **generally available** components on the internet.
